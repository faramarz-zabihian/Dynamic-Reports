# Dynamic report generator (web-baes)

This is a web-based reporting tool with a very user-friendly interface, allowing business application users to create and preview custom tabular reports and download them as full PDF, Word, or Excel files. It is fast and easy to use.

In the past, I have designed and developed three report generators using FoxPro, Delphi, and C# ASP.NET. This is the latest one, which I have updated with the latest libraries and frameworks and converted all the JavaScript files to TypeScript. However, as this is an old project, it relies on WCF and .NET 4.5, although both can be replaced with .NET Core and REST technology within a few hours.

Converting and debugging the JavaScript routines is time-consuming, so the report generator's functionality is not yet complete. Currently, I am focusing on achieving full functionality for the report generator.
This tool is currently designed to be right-to-left (RTL), but changing its templates can easily switch the interface and language to left-to-right (LTR).

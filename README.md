# Dynamic report generator (web-based)

This is a web-based reporting tool with a simple and user-friendly interface, allowing business application users to create and preview custom tabular reports and download them as full PDF, Word, or Excel files. It is fast and seemless to use.

In the past, I have designed and developed three report generators using FoxPro (DBASE), Delphi (Pascal), and C# ASP.NET. This is the latest one, which I have updated with the latest libraries and frameworks and converted all the JavaScript files to TypeScript. However, as this is an old project, it relies on WCF and .NET 4.5, but can be migrated to .NET Core and REST or gRPC technology within a few hours.

Converting and debugging the JavaScript routines is time-consuming, so its functionality is not yet complete. Currently, I am focusing on achieving complete functionality for the report generator.
This tool is designed for right-to-left (RTL) interfaces, but changing its templates can easily switch the interface and language to left-to-right (LTR).
